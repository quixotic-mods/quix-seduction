# Quixotic Seduction - Crusader Kings 3 Mod
**Version: 1.2.2.001**
*by El Ingenioso Hidalgo y Caballero Don Quixote de la Mancha ~ https://DonQuixote.Games/*

**Adds 20 NEW Seduction Outcome Events**

Tired of making love in the privy?

I have created this mod to greatly expand the variety in Seduction Outcome events. In vanilla, there are 15 seduction outcome success events, and many of these are conditional for events like bedding the pope or being gluttonous. This mod more than doubles the available seduction outcome events, and greatly expands the variety of non-conditional random outcomes. I have tried to keep the style relatively close to vanilla, although my events are slightly more detailed than vanilla as I assume that is what the people want. It does not alter game mechanics or probabilities, it is intended for immersion, roleplay, and flavor.

I hope you enjoy it!

Your Humble Servant,
Don Quixote de la Mancha

## Compatibility
This mod is NOT compatible with other murder scheme event mods. Technically speaking, I am overwriting murder_on_actions.txt because this is the only way I can figure out to insert the custom events into schemes. If you know a better way, please let me know. Mod authors, I would be happy to release a patch for your mod and give you everything you need to release one for mine, hit me up. If you want it to load Quixotic Murder events into another mod, like a total conversion, run it lower in the load order.

Beyond murder scheme mods, this mod should be fully compatible with just about everything. If the mod doesn't contain murder_on_actions.txt - it's fully compatible!

## Installation
Put in your CK3 Mods Folder. Usually this is:
C:\users\\%username%\documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod

If you install the mod manually, be sure to delete any previous versions rather than overwriting (as some files are subject to removal).

## Mod Content
Additions:
* 20 new seduction scheme outcome events

## Roadmap
* Ongoing seduction events that aren't boring.
* More conditional events
* New failure events
* Expand to add romance schemes

More scheme event mods for schemes other than murder coming soon, eventually extending to all schemes! Stay tuned, my friends.

## Content Warning
This is a seduction mod, and as such, you should not be surprised to learn it contains descriptions of human sexuality. There is no explicit language, but sexuality is expressed in a similar manner to vanilla content.

## Special Thanks
Thanks to:
* Dulcinea, her most serene beauty, for always being my creative muse.
* My most noble squire, Sancho Panza.

I would also ask a personal favor that you do not use the name Quixotic in the title just to not confuse people as I will hopefully be publishing many more mods under this moniker.
